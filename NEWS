	The adventure begins!  Created a new source directory, and started
	copying sample code into it.

	Sent Blursk 1.0 to Olle at xmms.org.

2000-01-08
	Added every feature that I wanted to add, except full-screen.
	I also have a long list of requests from other people.

	Added full-screen mode.  Unfortunately, XMMS' full-screen functions
	depend on dynamically-linked versions of the -lXxf86vm and -lXxf86dga
	but the default distribution of XFree86 only compiled statically-
	linked versions of those libraries.  For testing, I got around that
	by adding /usr/X11R6/lib/libXxf86vm.a and /usr/X11R6/lib/libXxf86dga.a
	to the XMMS link command.  I did *NOT* try adding it to Blursk's link
	line, because I believe that would cause problems if two or more
	plugins did that.

	I don't know how to make autoconf test whether a dynamic version of
	a library is available, so I disabled full-screen mode.

2000-12-11
	Turned Blursk maintenance over to Josh Huber.

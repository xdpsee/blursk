1999-12-07
	The adventure begins!  Created a new source directory, and started
	copying sample code into it.

1999-12-14
	Sent Blursk 1.0 to Olle at xmms.org.

2000-01-08
	Added every feature that I wanted to add, except full-screen.
	I also have a long list of requests from other people.

2000-03-14
	Added full-screen mode.  Unfortunately, XMMS' full-screen functions
	depend on dynamically-linked versions of the -lXxf86vm and -lXxf86dga
	but the default distribution of XFree86 only compiled statically-
	linked versions of those libraries.  For testing, I got around that
	by adding /usr/X11R6/lib/libXxf86vm.a and /usr/X11R6/lib/libXxf86dga.a
	to the XMMS link command.  I did *NOT* try adding it to Blursk's link
	line, because I believe that would cause problems if two or more
	plugins did that.

	I don't know how to make autoconf test whether a dynamic version of
	a library is available, so I disabled full-screen mode.

2001-09-10
	Changed the way presets are stored.  Now they're in a separate file,
	so they should be easier to share.

	Color is now included in presets.

	A new "Random preset on quiet" setting causes one of the other
	presets to be selected randomly during each quiet period -- which
	will hopefully change the settings for each song.

	Added a few more colormaps, blur motions, rendering methods, etc.

	Added the ability to "paste" configuration strings into Blursk by
	middle-clicking on the Blursk window.

2002-09-16
	Version 1.2 released

2002-01-11
	Added fullscreen support via the XVideo extension.

	Added an "Advanced" configuration dialog, mostly for setting the
	fullscreen options.

2002-05-30
	Fixed the bug that caused the stored window position to be slightly
	off.  Now, it should be restored to the exact position.

	Fixed a bug in the "beat sensitivity" slider.  Apparently it was
	damaged at some time when it wasn't on any config window.  It still
	doesn't have as much impact as I'd hoped, but at least it does, works.

	Replaced "random dots" with a more versatile "floaters" feature.

	Added support for a variety of background modes -- it won't always
	have a black background anymore!

	Added a few more blur motions, plot styles, etc.

	Added an option to fine-tune the blurring style.  This one is subtle!
	I added it because I noticed that in some modes, a lot of the pixels
	seemed to vibrate using the normal "Area smooth"; the "Edge smooth"
	fixes that, but causes large areas to show a checkerboard pattern,
	which doesn't look as good when using the XVideo fullscreen mode.

2002-06-02
	Modified the XVideo fullscreen modes to use planar video modes.
	MPEG players use planar modes, so they're probably more stable.

	Added support for the ZXCVB keys in fullscreen mode -- they now
	control XMMS' main buttons.

	Removed support for the "filter" option.

	Added a new "show window title" option.  Sawfish needs it; without
	this option, it ignored Blursks requested position, and instead
	places the window in the least useful possible position.

2002-06-14
	Modified the "Use XV" full-screen method to minimize artifacts

	Added a "show info" option, which adds the track title to the image.

	Lots of minor tweaks & bug fixes.

2002-06-15
	Fixed a bug: If the window was positioned off-screen, then the
	initialization code was supposed to move it back on-screen.  There
	was a bug in this, but it is fixed now.

	Added "Flame" to the list of color styles that work well with
	"Bump Effect".

	When "Milky" is used with "Bump effect", the flat area color is now
	influenced by the background color instead of the base color.
	(Actually, a little of the base color is still blended in with it;
	I thought that looked a little more interesting.)

2002-06-16
	Made changes in the title be treated like quiet -- it triggers the
	"Random preset on quiet" or "Random quiet" settings.

2002-06-17
	Added <i> key to show info even if info is normally disabled.

	Made the info text shimmer.  Also, it will no longer leave a blur
	trail in Fast CPU/Normal effect modes.
